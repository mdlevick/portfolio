                <p>My name is Michael Levick and I have been working with and on computers for over 20 years. until recently it has been, in a more Technical Support aspect. My first computer was an IBM P/S 1 with Windows 3.0 and DOS. I enjoy learning and continue to do so daily and plan to do so for the rest of
					my days. I am a student at Lambda School and plan to graduate in April of 2020. I have a project in
					mind, once I learn enough and I think it will be well received. To describe it better, it would be a
					more simple version of GitHub. I enjoy Video Games and would like to learn to develop them in the
					future.</p>
